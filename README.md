### Steps to Achieve Financial Loan Analysis Report

#### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
   - **Gather Data:** Collect data on loan applications, funding, repayments, interest rates, and borrower details.
   - **Clean Data:** Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure data consistency.

#### 2. Setting Up the Excel Dashboard
   - **Create Sheets:** Set up separate sheets for raw data, summary statistics, and visualizations.
   - **Input Data:** Enter the cleaned data into the respective sheets.

#### 3. Calculations and Metrics
   - **Loan Summary Metrics:** Calculate total applications, funded amounts, received amounts, average interest rates, and DTI ratios using Excel formulas (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE).

   - **Payment Scenarios:** Model scenarios for different interest rates and extra payments.

#### 4. Visualizations
   - **Charts and Graphs:** Create line charts for monthly applications, bar charts for applications by purpose and employee length, pie charts for loan terms and homeownership status.
   - **Maps:** Use map charts to visualize loan applications by state.

#### 5. Analysis of Good vs. Bad Loans
   - **Categorize Loans:** Separate loans into 'Good' and 'Bad' based on repayment status.
   - **Calculate Metrics:** Determine the number of applications, funded amounts, and amounts received for each category.

#### 6. Dashboard Integration
   - **Interactive Elements:** Add filters for loan grade and purpose to make the dashboard interactive.
   - **Summary Sections:** Summarize key insights and performance metrics.

#### 7. Review and Validation
   - **Validate Data:** Cross-check calculations and visualizations for accuracy.
   - **Update Regularly:** Keep the data and dashboard updated with the latest information.
